# Responsive-Portfolio

-----Description-----

In this homework assigment, I build a responsive portfolio that is viewable and functionsal on any device at varying screen widths.  At width 980px, 768px, and 640px the elements on the page should align differently.  The webpage includes a functional navigation bar that will link to an "About Me" page, a portfolio page, and a contact page.  The website was built using the grid layout and other helpful components from bootstrap.
