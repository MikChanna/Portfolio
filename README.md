# Portfolio

A simple, yet resposive website to showcase my top 3 projects so far.  The webpage includes a functional navigation bar that will link to an "About Me" page, a portfolio page, and a contact page.  My resume and important links are inlcuded.  The portfolio page has a carousel component that displays the project and if the user clicks on the title it will open up the website in another window.
